## What's a community center?

-   A site that functions as either a large residential center or as a place for
    social interaction, often both.
-   Identified archaeologically by the presence of civic architecture or more
    households than can be reasonably related by reckoned kinship (e.g., great
    houses and great kivas).

## Why do they get established where they do?

Is it because it's more productive at those locations (like C1) or more central
(like C2)?

## Model

Outcome of interest is a Poisson-distributed random variable $N$ of centers per unit area.

$$
N_{i} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{i})\\
E(N_{i}) = \lambda_{i}\\
log(\lambda_{i}) = \beta X_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
$$

-   covariates $X$ include gravity-weigted BC, precipitation, and maize GDD
-   $\epsilon_{i}$ is the random error
-   model also includes fixed effects for study area and time period

Fitting an approximation of this model with **down-sampled random forest**.

## Network Centrality

::: {.r-stack width="100%"}
::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index="0" style="margin-top:0;"}
For graph $G(V,E)$ with vertices $V$ and edges $E$, the **gravity-weighted
betweenness centrality** of vertex $v \in V$ is given by:

$$gBC(v) = \sum_{s,t \in V; s\neq v\neq t}^{N} I_{s,t}(v)\cdot G_{s,t}$$

where

-   $I_{s,t}(v)$ is the indicator function that is 1 if on shortest path between $s$
and $t$, 0 otherwise and
-   $G_{s,t}$ is the gravitational attraction between $s$ and $t$

**But...**

... in a highly structured spatial grid graph, gBC is just a wordy synonym for **population density**.

## Conclusions

This analysis is more exploratory than final, but tentatively...

1. You should always prefer the simpler model.
2. Community centers positively co-vary with the density and distribution of farms.
3. The relationship between farms and centers varies by region.

Next step is to model the co-occurrence of farms and centers directly.
